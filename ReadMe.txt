# To-Do List Application

## Project Overview
This is a GUI-based To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to add, delete, search, and manage tasks with different priority levels and completion statuses. It utilizes a combination of data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees for efficient task management.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and search tasks.
- **Priority Sorting**: Organizes tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low) using a Binary Search Tree.
- **Task Completion Tracking**: Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **GUI with Tkinter**: User-friendly interface with styled widgets.
- **Hash Table Search**: Enables efficient searching of tasks by description.
- **Linked List for Storage**: Maintains task order dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Tkinter** (GUI Framework)
- **Pillow** (Image Processing for Icons & Background)
- **Data Structures**: Linked List, Hash Table, Binary Search Tree
